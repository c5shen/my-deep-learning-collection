# Sequence-to-sequence language translation model
A sequence-to-sequence language translation model with gradient recurrent units (GRUs), Attention module, and Beam Search algorithm.

To run tests on the current implementation:
```
python tests.py -m unittest tests
```

To use the seq2seq model with Attention module and beam search:
```
python seq2seq_attention.py -h      # get help printout
```
